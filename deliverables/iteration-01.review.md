## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
* To define the basic app structure and data flow. This focuses preliminary work on UI with a few considerations to the back end. Work on the backend will primarily focus on the design of schemas for users and the general architecture of the site.

* To find ways to incentivize users. The current plan is to begin laying the foundations for a credit system. Users will get credits for uploading lectures, and viewing another lecture will take credits. Ideally this system will encourage users to contribute (i.e. upload videos) as well as discouraging people from skipping class.

* To continue thinking about how to bring the classroom experience online. This includes ongoing research into the most prominent aspects of lectures and how we can add more features to replicate those aspects. Additionally we are looking to improve the utility of our current ideas.
