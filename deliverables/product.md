#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Students do not always get to enjoy the full lecture experience. This is because they either missed it or were not able to absorb all of the material during lecture. We are proposing to make a  _*web app*_ that brings the lecture experience outside the classroom. Our platform will give users the ability to post and review lecture recordings online.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? 

Our target users are University of Toronto students who wish to view previous lectures. This includes students who have missed particular lectures, and/or students who simply wish to rewatch them.

Here are some personas that would cover majority of types of people that could be benefited greatly by this web app:

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

  Our product fills a niche in the market as there are no platforms that provide complete collection of lecture recordings for all classes. We will provide a platform where users can access recordings of all their lectures in one place. At the moment, students ask classmates for notes, ask questions on online discussion boards (e.g. piazza), review online notes, attend different lecture times for the same class (if any) and go to office hours for additional help. The benefits of our web app over these alternatives is that it is convenient; students can get access to a database of lectures, highlight, pause and rewatch moments of a lecture, and choose between multiple recordings of the same lecture.

### Highlights

The initial idea to develop an all-in-one student application that covered everything a student might need: scheduling, finding nearby food places,etc. However,  after much thought, we narrowed the problem down to something related to attending lectures as that is the fundamental task to complete for a student to keep up with university life.

The problem we wanted to tackle was incentivizing students to attend their classes, since this is a common issue we have witnessed and experienced. 
* Initially we were thinking about a point-based system that would accumulate as students attend lectures, but we realized that since there was no value to these points, there was no value to incentivize on.
* We finally landed on the idea of solving two problems at once: incentivizing going to class, and handling the cases when students miss class or need to rewatch lectures.

The idea of solving these problems via livestreaming the lectures came up, but due to the complexity, we decided to go down the simpler path of recording and uploading.
* While this is a very good idea and would be popular with students, especially commuters, it was not within our range technically and would not be worth pursuing at the moment.

Another feature we thought of is tagging important moments in the video so viewers donâ€™t miss crucial parts of the class, especially ones that would only be heard if they went to class.
* This feature should be relatively simple to implement and would add a lot of value to our product.
